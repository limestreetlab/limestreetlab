<div id="problem">

  A basketball team, Chicago Labrador, will play a 44-game season. 
  <br>
  26 of these games are against Toronto Python and 18 are against Seattle Dolphin.
  <br>
  Assume the Labrador has a winning probability of 0.4 against the Python and 0.7 against the Dolphin.
  <br>
  Game results are independent. What's the probability that
  <ul>
    <li>Chicago Labrador will win at least 25 games in the season;</li>
    <li>Chicago Labrador will win more games against Toronto Python than against Seattle Dolphin.</li>
  </ul>

<div id="solution">

  Let $W_T, W_S$ denote winnings against Toronto and Seattle, which are binomial $r.v. $,
  \begin{align}
    E(W_T) = (26)(0.4) & = 10.4 \quad & Var(W_T) & = (26)(0.4)(0.6) = 6.24 \\
    E(W_S) = (18)(0.7) & = 12.6 \quad & Var(W_S) & = (18)(0.7)(0.3) = 3.78
  \end{align}
  
  Given independence,
  \begin{align}
  & E(W_T + W_S)  = E(W_T) + E(W_S) = 23.0 \\  
  & Var(W_T + W_S) = Var(W_T) + Var(W_S) = 10.02
  \end{align}

  Approximating using normal,
  \begin{align}
    P(W_T+W_S \geq 25) & = P(Z \geq \frac{25-23}{\sqrt{10.02}}) \\
    & \approx P(Z \geq 0.63) \\
    & \approx 1 - P(Z \lt 0.63) \\
    & \approx 1 - 0.74 \\
    & \approx 0.26 
  \end{align}
  <br>
  Now, $W_T - W-S$ is also normal with $E(W_T - W_S) = -2.2 \text{ and } Var(W_T - W_S) = 10.02$,
  \begin{align}
    P(W_T \gt W_S) & = P(W_T - W_S \geq 1) \\
    & = P(Z \geq \frac{3.2}{\sqrt{10.02}}) \\
    & \approx P(Z \geq 1.01) = 1 - P(Z \lt 1.01) \\
    & \approx 1 - 0.844 \approx 0.16
  \end{align}

  Hence, the probabilities are about $26\% \text{ and } 16\%$, respectively.
