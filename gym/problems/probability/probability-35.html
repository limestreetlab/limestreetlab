<div id="problem">
Sally is preparing for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) qualification which requires passing 3 exams sequentially.
<br>
The probability of her passing the level-1 exam is $90\%$.
<br>
If she passes level-1, then the probability of passing level-2 is $80\%$.
<br>
If she passes the first 2 levels, then she has $70\%$ probability in passing level-3 and becoming a CFA. 
<br>
<ol>
  <li>What's the probability she becomes a CFA without any re-sitting?</li>
  <li>Given she did not pass all three exams, what's the conditional probability that she failed the level-2 exam?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="solution">
a. 

Let $L_1, L_2, L_3$ denote the events of passing level-1, level-2, and level-3. The desired probability is
$$
P(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3) = P(L_1) \cdot P(L_2 | L_1) \cdot P(L_3 | L_1 \cap L_2) = 0.9 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.7 = 0.504
$$
<br>
b.
The event of not passing all three exams is $(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3)^c$. The desired probability is
$$
P({L_2}^c | (L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3)^c) = \frac{P(L_1) \cdot P(L_2)^c }{ P{(L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3)}^c } = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.2}{1 - 0.504} \approx 0.36 
$$
