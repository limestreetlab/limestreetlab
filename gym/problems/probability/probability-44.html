<div id="problem">
Peter is to give away 10 (identical) coins to 4 people. How many possible ways can he do it? 
<br>
For example, $(4, 2, 1, 3)$ and $(0, 8, 2, 0)$ are possible ways.

</div>

<div id="solution">
Say the four people are Alice, Bob, Cat, Dave. We can then view the process as picking a name from $4$ possible objects (A,B,C,D) with replacement $10$ times.
A possible outcome can be CDDABCBBDA, which is equivalent to AABBBCCDDD since order is not important, where the coins are divided by $(2, 3, 2, 3)$.
<br><br>
This is picking n objects from N objects with replacement and when order is not important. The formula is $\binom{n + N - 1}{N - 1}$.
<br>
Thus, the number of possible ways is 
$$
\binom{10 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \binom{13}{3} = 286
$$
