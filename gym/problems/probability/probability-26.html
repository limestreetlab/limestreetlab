<div id="problem">
 
  Two fair dice are rolled sequentially. What's the probability that the second die lands on a higher value than that of the first?

</div>

<div id="solution">
  For the 2nd die to be higher than the 1st,
  <br><br>
  If 1st die is $1$, then 2nd must be $ \{ 2,3,4,5,6 \} $. 
  <br>
  If 1st die is $2$, then 2nd must be $ \{ 3,4,5,6 \} $. 
  <br>
  $\ldots$
  <br>
  If 1st die is $5$, then 2nd must be $ \{ 6 \} $.
  <br>
  If 1st die is $6$, then 2nd cannot have a higher value.
  <br><br>  

  Hence, the desired probability is
  \begin{align}
    & \frac{1}{6}\frac{5}{6} + \frac{1}{6}\frac{4}{6} +\frac{1}{6}\frac{3}{6} +\frac{1}{6}\frac{2}{6} +\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{6} + 0 \\
    & \approx 0.42
  \end{align}
