a.
<br>
Let $F$ and $B$ denote respectively the events that the coin is fair and biased (unfair). Also let $H_i$ denote that the $i^\text{th}$ flip is a head.
<br>
\begin{align}
  P(F | H_1) & = \frac{P(H_1 | F)P(F)}{P(H_1 | F)P(F)+P(H_1 | B)P(B)} \\
  & = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.5 \cdot 0.5 + 1 \cdot 0.5} \\
  & = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
<br>

b.
<br>
Because coin flips are independent, we can update the conditional probability sequentially using the previous posterior probability as the prior probability.
\begin{align}
  P(F | H_1 \cap H_2) & = \frac{P(H_2 | F)P(F | H_1)}{P(H_2 | F)P(F | H_1) + P(H_2 | B)P(B | H_1)} \\
  & = \frac{0.5 \cdot 1/3}{0.5 \cdot 1/3 + 1 \cdot 2/3} \\
  & = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}
<br>

c.
<br>
Again, use the previous posterior probability as the prior probability.
\begin{align}
  P(F | H_1 \cap H_2 \cap H_3) & = \frac{P(H_3 | F)P(F | H_1 \cap H_2)}{P(H_3 | F)P(F | H_1 \cap H_2) + P(H_3 | B)P(B | H_1 \cap H_2)} \\
  & = \frac{0.5 \cdot 1/5}{0.5 \cdot 1/5 + 1 \cdot 4/5} \\
  & = \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{10}{9} = \frac{1}{9}
\end{align}
<br>
If it instead lands tail, it is <em>obvious</em> that the coin must be the fair one and the desired probability is $1$.
\begin{align}
  P(F | H_1 \cap H_2 \cap H_3^c) & = \frac{P(H_3^c | F)P(F | H_1 \cap H_2)}{P(H_3^c | F)P(F | H_1 \cap H_2) + P(H_3^c | B)P(B | H_1 \cap H_2)} \\
  & = \frac{0.5 \cdot 1/5}{0.5 \cdot 1/5 + 0 \cdot 4/5} \\
  & = \frac{1/10}{1/10} = 1
\end{align}
