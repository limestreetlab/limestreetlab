<div id="problem">
The <i>problem of points</i> relates to how a pot should be divided between the players when the game must be stopped before a final winner appears.<br>
The idea is to allocate the pot proportional to each player's probability of winning the entire pot if the game were to continue until the end.
<br><br>
Let $p$ and $1-p$ denote probability of success and failure in independent game trials. 
<br>
A and B play a game such that A gains 1 point if a success occurs and B gains 1 point if a failure occurs.
<br>
Compute the proportional pot to allocate to A if the game is interrupted when A need $n$ and B need $m$ more points to win.

  
</div>

<div id="solution">

The proportional pot for A should be the probability that $n$ successes occur before $m$ failures.<br>
In order for $n$ successes before $m$ failures, it's necessary and sufficient that there be at least $n$ successes in $n + m - 1$ trials.<br>
It is true, for if there are at least $n$ successes in the first $n + m - 1$ trials, there are at most $m - 1$ failures so $n$ successes occur before $m$ failures.
If there are less than $n$ successes, there are at least $m$ failures in those $n + m - 1$ trials so $m$ failures occur first.
<br><br>
It follows that the desired probability is
$$
  \sum_{k=n}^{n+m-1}{ {n+m-1} \choose k}\cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n+m-1-k} 
$$
