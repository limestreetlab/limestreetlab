<div id="problem">
Spencer has a long position in a stock currently trading at \$50. <br>
He will take profit at \$65 or stop loss at \$35, a $\pm \$15$ P&L window. 
<br>
Assume price movements are discrete at \$1-step and independent, with probabilities 0.55 up and 0.45 down.<br>
What's the probability that this stock will end up a winner?

<div id="solution">

Recall the <a href="problems/probability/probability-41-link.html" target="_blank"> <u><i>gambler's ruin problem</i></u></a> and its formula $ P(\text{win}) = \frac{1-(q/p)^i}{1-(q/p)^N}$ where $i$ is the initial stake, $N$ the total stake to win, $p$ the probability of a win, and $q$ the probability of a loss.
<br><br>
Applying here, $ \frac{q}{p} = \frac{0.45}{0.55} = \frac{9}{11} $, $i = 15$, $N = 30$ ,

$$
P(\text{take profit}) = \frac{1 - (9/11)^{15}}{1 - (9/11)^{30}} \approx 0.95
$$
