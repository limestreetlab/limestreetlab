<div id="problem">
  We have a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. We turn up cards from the deck one at a time until an ace appears.
  <br>
  Once we stop, is the next card in the deck &mdash;that is, the card following the first ace&mdash;	more likely to be the ace of spade or the king of heart?

</div>

<div id="solution">

  We first consider how many of the $52!$ possible orderings of cards have the ace of spade immediately after the first ace.
  <br>
  For each of the $51!$ orderings of the other cards, there is only $1$ slot the ace of spade can be placed such that it follows the first ace.
  <br>
  For example, if the ordering of the $51$ other cards is 
  $$
    4c, 8h, Kd, 4d, 5s, Ac, 8s, \dots, Jh, 10d 
  $$
  then the only slot for ace of spade to result in its following the first ace is
  $$
     4c, 8h, Kd, 4d, 5s, Ac, As, 8s, \dots, Jh, 10d 
  $$
  Hence, there are $51!$ orderings of the ace of spade following the first ace, so
  $$
    P(\text{ace of spade following the first ace}) = \frac{51!}{52!} = \frac{1}{52}
  $$
  <br>
  By exactly the same argument, it follows that the probability that the king of heart (or any other specific card) follows the first ace is also $\frac{1}{52}$. 
  <br>
  That is to say, each of the $52$ cards following the first ace is equally likely.
