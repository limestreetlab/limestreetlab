<div id="problem">
    Boyfriend and girlfriend are to meet at a Chinatown hotel.
    <br>
    Their arrival times are independent and uniformly distributed over a one hour period. 
    <br>
    What's the probability that whoever arrives first will have to wait longer than 10 minutes.
</div>

<div id="solution">
Let $X$ and $Y$ denote their arrival times, which are independent uniform $r.v.$ over (0, 60).
<br>
So we want $P(X+10\lt Y) + P(Y+10 \lt X)$, which by symmetry, $= 2P(X+10\lt Y)$.
\begin{align}
  2P(X+10\lt Y) &= 2\iint\limits_{x+10 \lt y} f_X(x) f_Y(y) dx dy\\ 
  &= 2\int_{10}^{60} \int_0^{y-10} (\frac{1}{60})^2dxdy \\
  & = \frac{2}{60^2} \int_{10}^{60} (y - 10)dy \\ 
  & = \frac{2}{60^2} \cdot \left(\frac{y^2}{2} - 10y\right)\bigg |_{10}^{60} \\
  & = \frac{2}{60^2} \cdot \left( (\frac{60^2}{2}-(10)(60)) - (\frac{10^2}{2}-(10)(10)) \right)\\
  & \approx 0.69

\end{align}
