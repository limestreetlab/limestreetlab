<div id="problem">
  Consider the following game.
  <br>
  Tiger rolls a fair die. If he rolls 3 or less, $\{1,2,3\}$, he loses the game immediately.
  <br>
  Otherwise, he is dealt as many cards from a 52-card deck as the number on the die&mdash;that is, $\{4,5,6\}$.
  <br>
  Tiger wins only if all four aces are among the dealt cards.
  <br>  
  Compute the probability of winning this game.

</div>

<div id="solution">

Let $W$ be the event of winning and $R_i$ of rolling $i$ on the die. 
<br>
The game is lost immediately if the roll is $\{1,2,3\}$, so $P(W|R_1) = P(W|R_2) = P(W|R_3) = 0$.
<br>
Moreover,
\begin{align}
  P(W|R_4) & = \frac{4 \choose 4}{52 \choose 4} \\
  P(W|R_5) & = \frac{ {4 \choose 4}{48 \choose 1} }{52 \choose 5} \\
  P(W|R_6) & = \frac{ {4 \choose 4}{48 \choose 2 } }{52 \choose 6} \\
\end{align}
Hence, 
\begin{align}
  P(W) &= \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{4 \choose 4}{52 \choose 4} + \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{ {4 \choose 4}{48 \choose 1} }{52 \choose 5} + \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{ {4 \choose 4}{48 \choose 2 } }{52 \choose 6} \\
       &\approx 0.0013\%
\end{align}
