    <li>The probability is simply $\frac{1}{2}$ as the younger child has equal chance to be a boy or a girl. <br>
        The original permutations of the two children are $\{BB\}$, $\{BG\}$, $\{GB\}$, $\{GG\}$, where the first letter denotes the first (older) child. 
        After knowing the older child is a boy, only $\{BB\}$ and $\{BG\}$ remain, so the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$. 
    </li>

    <li>
        The probability is simply $\frac{1}{2}$ as the absent child has equal chance to be a boy or a girl. <br>
        Let <b>bold</b> letter denote one of the two children she is with, the permutations are $\{\textbf{B}B\}$, $\{B\textbf{B}\}$, $\{\textbf{B}G\}$, $\{B\textbf{G}\}$, $\{\textbf{G}B\}$, $\{G\textbf{B}\}$, $\{\textbf{G}G\}$, $\{G\textbf{G}\}$.
        But the present child is a boy, so only $\{\textbf{B}B\}$, $\{B\textbf{B}\}$, $\{\textbf{B}G\}$, and $\{G\textbf{B}\}$ remain, of which only two indicate the other child is also a boy. Hence, the probability is $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.
    </li>

    <li>
        There are $2^2 = 4$ possible arrangements for two children, $\{BB\}$, $\{BG\}$, $\{GB\}$, $\{GG\}$. 
        Having the information that at least one is a boy eliminates $\{GG\}$, so the probability becomes $\frac{1}{3}$, higher than the uninformed probability of two boys $\frac{1}{4}$.
    </li>
    
</ol>

Basically, the first and second give information only about one specific child and nothing at all about the other child individually so probability remains at $\frac{1}{2}$, wheras the last adds information to the collective set of two children so probability improves on the set.
