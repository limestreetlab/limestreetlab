<div id="problem">
  
  $N$ people in a meeting room throw their hats on the floor, which are then mixed. 
  <br>
  Each person randomly picks one as he leaves.
  <br>
  What's the expected number of matches? That is, find the average number of people picking their own hats.

</div>

<div id="solution">

  Let $X$ denote the number of matches, 
  $$X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \ldots + X_N$$
  where 
  $$X_i = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \quad \text{if $i$th person picks own hat} \\ 
    0 \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  We know,
  $$
  E(X_i) = P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{N}
  $$
  Because expected value of a sum is sum of the individual expected values,
  $$
    E(X) = \underbrace{ E(X_1) + E(X_2) + \ldots + E(X_N) }_\text{N} = N \frac{1}{N} = 1 
  $$
