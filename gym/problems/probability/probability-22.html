<div id="problem">
  From a regular poker deck of 52 cards, what's the probability of being dealt a straight?
  <br><br>
  <small>
  Note: a straight is a 5-card hand consisting of distinct consecutive values and not all of the same suit.

<div id="solution">

  We start by noting that all $ {52 \choose 5} $ possible hands are equally likely.
  <br><br>
  Let's first consider a straight of ${A2345}$.
  <br>
  Each card can come from any 1 of the 4 suits, so there are $ 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 4^5 $ outcomes for $ {A2345} $.
  <br>
  Because 4 of such outcomes are of the same suit (straight flush), there are $ 4^5 - 4 $ possible ways of a ${A2345}$ straight.
  <br><br>
  Now, there are $ 10 $ different straights of $ {A2345} \: {23456} \: {34567} \dots {10JQKA} $. 
  <br>
  Hence, there are $ 10(4^5 - 4) $ hands of straights, and it follows that the probability of being dealt a straight is
  $$
  \frac{10(4^5-4)}{52 \choose 5} \approx 0.0039 \approx {4\%}
  $$
