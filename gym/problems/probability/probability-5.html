<div id="problem">
  An ordinary deck of 52 cards is dealt into 4 hands.
  <br>
  What's the probability of each hand having an ace?
</div>

<div id="solution">

  Let $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ represent each ace. <br>
  The probability of $A_1$ in any hands is $1$. <br>
  Having $A_1$ fixed in one hand, the probability of $A_2$ in any of the remaining $3$ hands is $\frac{39}{51}$. 
  <br>
  Having $A_1, A_2$ fixed in two different hands, the probability of $A_3$ in any of the remaining $2$ hands is $\frac{26}{50}$.
  <br>
  Hence, $P(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 \text{ in different hands})$ is,
  $$ 
  \frac{52}{52} \cdot \frac{39}{51} \cdot \frac{26}{50} \cdot \frac{13}{49} \approx 0.105. 
  $$
