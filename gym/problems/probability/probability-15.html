<div id="problem">

  There are $3$ cards in a box. <br>
  Card $1$ has both sides red.<br>
  Card $2$ has both sides black. <br>
  Card $3$ has one side red and one side black.<br>
  A card randomly drawn shows one side is red.<br>
  What's the probability that the other side is black.
</div>

<div id="solution">

  \begin{align}
    P(RB|R) &= \frac{P(RB \cap R)}{P(R)} \\
    &= \frac{P(R|RB)P(RB)}{P(R|RB)P(RB) + P(R|BB)P(BB) + P(R|RR)P(RR)} \\
    &= \frac{(0.50)(0.33)}{(0.5)(0.33) + (0)(0.33) + (1)(0.33)} \\
    & = \frac{0.165}{0.165+0.33} = 0.33

  \end{align}
