<li>
Assume rolling the dice in sequence, the first roll can be any number, the second has to be the remaining $5$ numbers, the third the remaining $4$ numbers, \dots . 
$$
\frac{6}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{6} \cdot \frac{2}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{720}{46656} \approx 1.5\%
$$
Alternatively, the number of possible ordered outcomes for $6$ dice is $6^6$ and number of outcomes of each number appearing once is $6!$, so 
$$
\frac{6!}{6^6} = \frac{720}{46656} \approx 1.5\%
$$
</li>

<li>
The $3$ different numbers can be picked in $\binom{6}{3}$ ways. After the $3$ numbers are picked, each of them has to fill $2$ <i>slots</i> in the $6$ <i>slots</i>.
There are \binom{6}{2} ways for the first number, \binom{4}{2} ways for the second number, and \binom{2}{2} for the third number. 
The probability of three pairs is therefore
$$
\frac{\binom{6}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} }{6^6} = \frac{1800}{46656} \approx 3.9\%
$$
