<div id="problem">
In a standard 5-card poker hand dealt from a 52 card deck, how many possible ways can it contain exactly one diamond card and exactly one ace card?

<div id="solution">
First note that the hand having the ace of diamonds meets both requirements. 
So there are two cases, one having the ace of diamonds and one not having the ace of diamonds.
<br><br>
For the hand not containing the ace of diamonds, there are $12$ possible cards of diamonds (excluding the ace card) and $3$ possible cards of aces (excluding the ace of diamonds).
There are $52 - 1 - 12 - 3 = 36$ remaining cards for the remaining hand. Thus, the number of possible hands is $\binom{12}{1} \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{36}{3} = 12 \cdot 3 \cdot 7140 = 257040$.
<br><br>
For the hand containing the ace of diamonds, the remaining cards can come from $52 - 13 - 3 = 36$ cards, so the number of possible hands is $1 \cdot \binom{36}{4} = 58905$.
<br><br>
Thus, the number of possible hands is $257040 + 58905 = 315945$. It is $\frac{315945}{_52 C_5} \approx 12\%$ of all possible hands.
